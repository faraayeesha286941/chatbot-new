# rasa-chatbot
This repository contains the Rasa chatbot project, which includes the bot's actions, training data, and PostgreSQL integration for the tracker store.

Tools to install : 
-Visual Studio Code or any preferred code editor.
-PostgreSQL for the database (version 12 or higher recommended).
-Rasa framework for chatbot.
-Python Version: 3.9
(Rasa 3.x is compatible with Python 3.8 and 3.9; use Python 3.9 for this project.)

1. Set Up Python Environment (do this after you install Python)
   1.1 make sure Python 3.9 installed and ensure it is added to your PATH (if you dont know how to do this, chatgpt it hahaha, or refer to the link I gave)
   1.2 create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv

2. How to install Rasa and Dependencies
   2.1 install Rasa: pip install rasa==3.6.0
   2.2 install other dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Postgresql setup
   3.1 all the setup already have in code
   3.2 to see the data, login database using this (password :123456) it is under server PostgresSQL 14
   3.3 if cannot access to database, I think you need to load the data in your own database.
(Steps on adding your database) -
1. make sure to add user
2. when adding a table under sceheme, do all the columns depending on the csv.
3. if any %DIV, u just let it be empty cell.
4. import the csv again

    5.3 after it finish train the chatbot, run command : rasa run actions
    5.4 to interact with chatbot in terminal, run command : rasa shell

6. How to run rasa chatbot on cesium :
